# Beat Machine - React Source Code Submodule

This little drum machine is a personal project made using React and styled with SCSS. This particular project was written using legacy React with Class Components and without React Hooks. This was done simply as an exercise to familiarize myself with the older React conventions, so that I could properly interpret older code and better understand the evolution of the library.

This is just the submodule containing the front-end React 'src' source folder. To see the entire project, go to [this repository](https://github.com/mackenziewritescode/drum-machine).
